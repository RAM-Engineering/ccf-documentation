### ** **Get Started** **

Steps to get started with this Documentation:

- Download obsidian
- Clone the Documentation repo
- Open the cloned repo as a vault in obsidian
- Turn on the 'git' community plugin

Now you can push changes to your feature branch as you add them using git on your computer!

*Branch Structure*

The "documentation" repo will have a "main" branch which will contain the final edited draft of all of the documentation. 

Branches should be made whenever a new segment of the docs is being added. This could be if you:
- Are researching a new software package
- Looking up notes on calculating battery specs and doing a few examples
- Documenting how you wired together the rasberry pi for your projects computer system
- ...Or anything else you think a new member (or beginning engineer) would not be aware of


### ** **What to Include** **

Knowing what to include in documentation is difficult. 

Ideally, when working on Ram Robotics projects you should sit down and pull the latest changes from the documentation repo (or make a new feature branch if you're researching something new) and then add whatever you are working on or researching in real time, committing every so often as needed. When done for the day, you would push to your branch and submit a pull request into "main" to be reviewed for detail and clarity by a VP or Project Lead.

So what kinds of things should you write down?

Well... Anything that could even slightly be useful

Examples:
- How are you thinking about the architecture of this software package?
- Why did you choose these specific motors? (cost, torque, size, heat requirements)
- Are the specs for this hardware difficult to read?, If so how did you manage to decipher them
- What are your thoughts as you go through researching competition designs? Do there seem to be patterns or common designs?
- Why did you choose to do a wire harness instead of embedding the wires?
- If some part of this design is incredibly complex, then is there a simple way to understand how it works?

The point of asking yourself these questions is to help you really understand your engineering process. 

As a bonus, this also allows future engineers taking your place to learn from your experience and avoid any pitfalls you've already encountered.

Documentation should explain why something works VERY CLEARLY. But more than that, it should explain why that something was needed in the first place.

### Conclusion

Documentation is a really difficult habit to start, but I hope that over time, you will start to see the rewards that we will gain as an organization from the hard work that needs to be put in. 

If anyone ever has any questions about the process and/or thinks their documents aren't up to high standards even when they try their best, just ship it anyway.  Setup a pull request and let the VPs or Project Leads verify and ask you questions. You will learn a lot from others reading your documentation

Happy Hacking!
