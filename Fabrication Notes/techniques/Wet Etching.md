Wet Etching is the etching (removal of material) of a solid material in a chemical solution. During this process, the substrate is either dipped into the solution or the solution is sprayed onto the substrate. This is different from [[Dry Etching]].

Typical wet etching in microelectronics is isotropic (not orientation dependent) although on occasion it can be anisotropic.

Advantages:
- High selectivity
- Relatively planar etching
- High repeatability
- The etch rate is controllable with etchant concentration
