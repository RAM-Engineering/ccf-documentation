Dry etching involves the removal of material from a target material/substrate using gases and/or plasmas rather than liquid chemicals as in [[Wet Etching]]

## Physical-Chemical Etching

All dry etching is fundamentally a form of physical-chemical etching (dry etching is just the umbrella term). The most important classifications for us are 
- [[Reactive Ion Etching (RIE)]]
- [[Anodic Plasma Etching (APE)]]
- [[Magnetically Enhanced Reactive Ion Etching (MERIE)]]
- [[Triode Reactive Ion Etching (TRIE)]]
- [[Transmision Coupled Plasma Etching (TCPE)]]

#### Physical Dry Etching

This method of etching involves using beams of ions, electrons, or photons to dislodge and evaporate particles from the target material. Almost all materials can be etching using this method but the drawbacks include:
- Slow etch rates
- Low selectivity for etched material
- Trench effects caused by reflection ions

#### Chemical Dry Etching

This method uses a chemical reaction between a gas and the target material to attack a material surface. All chemical dry etching requires gaseous products otherwise the deposition would block the process over time. This technique, similar to [[Wet Etching]], exhibits high selectivity to target material. 

This technique can also be used to clean wafers or substrates. As an example, photoresist can be removed using oxygen plasmas.
