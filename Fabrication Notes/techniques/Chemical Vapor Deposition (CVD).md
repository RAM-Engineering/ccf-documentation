Chemical Vapor Deposition is an [[Common Additive Manufacturing Techniques |additive]] manufacturing technique used to generate material thin films. In CVD, gaseous reactants are added to a reaction chamber. A heated substrate in the reaction chamber then interacts with the gas pumped in and material in the gas is deposited onto the substrate in a thin film. Other reactants then exit the chamber.

CVD can be split into different types based on reaction conditions:
- Atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD)
- Low-pressure CVD (LPCVD)
- Plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD)
