Transfer techniques are those used to add patterns onto a material or substrate using a combination of processing methods. There are two types of transfers: additive and subtractive

#### Subtractive Transfer

Uses both [[Lithography]] to pattern a [[photoresist]] on a substrate in the desired pattern (for both positive and negative photoresist). Then applies a selective [[Wet Etching]] to remove the specific substrate material left exposed by the photoresist. A final cleaning (often using [[Dry Etching]]) removes all photoresist and leaves the final patterned substrate


#### Additive Transfer

Similar to above, uses [[Lithography]] to pattern a [[Photoresist]] in the desired pattern (for both positive and negative photoresist). Then applies an [[Common Additive Manufacturing Techniques |additive technique]] to create a new layer on top of the cured photoresist. A final cleaning step removes the photoresist and any new material deposited on top of it, leaving only the new material deposited directly on the substrate.
