A method for creating [[Single Crystalline Silicon]] of extremely high purity. Although this is not the most used method ([[Czocharalski Method (CZ-Method)]] gets that award), this method is still useful for its high quality.

#### Process
- A poly crystalline silicon rod is placed with a single crystalline silicon seed crystal on one end
- A RF induction coil is used to heat a thin slice of the rod starting at the single crystalline seed crystal end. As the silicon is melted and cooled again, it reorients along with the single crystalline silicons orientation and becomes monocrystalline
- The RF induction coil is moved along the entire length of the polycrystalline rod.
- The impurities are concentrated at the tail end which is then removed (sliced off)
