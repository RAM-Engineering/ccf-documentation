Additive Manufacturing is when you decide to change a material by adding additional material onto a device. Think of 3D printing or other deposition techniques. These all slowly grow materials in order to change their form.

There are many common additive manufacturing techniques used in microfabrication including:
- [[Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)]]
- [[Thermal Oxidation]]
- [[Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)]]
- [[Sol-Gel Deposition]]
- [[Spin Coating]]
- [[Doping]]
