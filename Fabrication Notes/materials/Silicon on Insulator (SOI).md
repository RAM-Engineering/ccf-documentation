Silicon on Insulator is a wafer structure where a silicon dioxide is placed in the middle of a monolithic pure silicon substrate via [[Doping]]. This allows fewer parasitic effects and improves performance of the transistors on the wafer.

The process to make this wafer structure is called [[Separation by Implantation of Oxygen (SIMOX)]].

Although SOI wafers are important to the industry, they are not what is used today in large scale fabs. This is where bulk FINFET are used. SOI wafers still have applications in low power or analog devices however.
