Microfabrication techniques are techniques used to create micro or nano scale devices. 

### Types of Fabrication

Methods of fabrication can mostly be broken into [[Common Additive Manufacturing Techniques|Additive]] or [[ Common Subtractive Manufacturing Techniques|Subtractive]] techniques. Some methods such as [[Lithography|lithography]] fit into both.

Many processes use a combination of methods in order to achieve final results. Typical semiconductor fabrication uses both selective dry etching/deposition via photolithography mixed with non selective material targeted wet etching in order to alter the target material/substrate in the manner desired.

A list of many fabrication methods (although not exhaustive):
- [[Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)]]
- [[Thermal Oxidation]]
- [[Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)]]
- [[Sol-Gel Deposition]]
- [[Spin Coating]]
- [[Doping]]
- [[Dry Etching]]
- [[Wet Etching]]
- [[Lithography]]


#### Silicon and other materials

No conversation on microfabrication is complete without a discussion of silicon. Silicon is by far the most well established material for microfabrication due to its long history in microelectronics. One of the most important forms of silicon is [[Single Crystalline Silicon]].
