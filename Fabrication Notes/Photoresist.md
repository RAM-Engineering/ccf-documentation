Photoresist is a light sensitive polymeric coating typically used in [[Lithography|lithography]] to transfer a pattern into a substrate. 


### Positive Resist vs Negative Resist

There are two different types of photo resist. Positive and negative.

**Positive Resist:** Photoresist that is positive becomes soluble under light exposure. This happens because the photons break polymer chains or cause deprotection.

**Negative Resist:** Photoresist that is negative becomes less soluble (the polymer crosslinks) under light exposure. This happens because photons create reactive species that form covalent bonds between polymers and crosslink them
