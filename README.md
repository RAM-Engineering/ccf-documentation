# Carolina Chip Fab Documentation

Welcome to the Carolina Chip Fab Knowledge Base!

In this repo we use obsidian to store knowledge and documentation from all of our various projects. This includes team projects and smaller research projects.

Please first review the "What is Documentation.md" first if you are new to the organization.

If you are interested in learning more about fabrication, I highly reccomend checking out fabrication techniques and looking at the [[Intro to Microfabrication]].
