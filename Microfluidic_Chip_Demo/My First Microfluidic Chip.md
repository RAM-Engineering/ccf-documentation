In this demo I'll be designing and fabricating my first microfluidic chip. 

Things to do:
- Make the mask
- fabricate the channels on the slide
- punch input and output ports
## Process for Creating the Chip

1) Make the mask
2) ...


### 1) Make the mask

For making the mask, I used onshape to develop the channel

Then I loaded it into the klayout MEMS software to scale and export the mask file format. In klayout, it looks like this:

This is a relatively simple design so I don't have to worry about a lot of typical things you need to worry about for the mask design. These issues include worrying about layers and the cell hierarchy for reusable components. 

I also need to worry about input and output ports for these channels and idk how to do that right now.
